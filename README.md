**MCP Client Demonstration.**

In this project OpenAI is used as a MCP client which sends a prompt to MCP Server. 
We have already MCP Server https://github.com/Gangs2000/MCP-Server-Claude-AI **( MCP Server )** in place.

We have 7 API's exposed and all these API's have been registered in MCP server. When user send a prompt, server serves a response by identifying correct tool.

In the previous project, we used Claude AI as a client, in this current demonstration we have implemented OpenAI as a client. Response context will be analysed by OpenAI model and provides response to client with more details.

OpenAI is a paid one, in order to use any model available in OpenAI, first we have to purchase some credits, then create an API key to use the models.
